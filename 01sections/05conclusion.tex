\section{Conclusion}

Using PubMed and similar sources to identify experts is not new. However, there are significant challenges in using PubMed data that create technical and moral hazards. We have struck a potent blend of ideas, new and old, that together have not been seen before. We have emphasized user control to filter and select the most relevant results. We rank only as little as needed to present options that are expert enough, offering varied results when re-queried. 

We deployed a functioning application on the cloud, which is available for anyone. It has a core of valuable features and plentiful opportunities to expand. In addition, we ensure that the process can be replicated and reproduced, reducing the dependence on any few individuals and setting the stage for broader community feedback and contributions.
