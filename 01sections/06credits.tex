\section{Software Availability}

One of the core goals of this project was to create a resource that was open-source and available for community development and feedback. All project code, including this paper, can be found in our GitHub organization (\url{https://github.com/DoyenTeam}). The code and documentation for our back end and API can be found at (\url{https://github.com/DoyenTeam/doyen}), and our front end can be found at (\url{https://github.com/DoyenTeam/doyenclient}). Our back end uses Python for our ingestion pipeline and C# for our API. The front-end is implemented using NextJS and Tailwind for styling.
