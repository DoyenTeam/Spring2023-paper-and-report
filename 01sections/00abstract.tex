\section*{Abstract}
This paper presents Doyen, a web application that leverages Elasticsearch and PubMed data to identify and rank expert researchers in a given domain. Elasticsearch enables rapid search and retrieval of relevant authors based on user-specified search terms, including MeSH and general keywords. The application processes roughly 9 million of the most recent articles on PubMed, with an automated update mechanism to stay current with new research publications. The core of Doyen lies in its expert score to rank authors, considering the relevance of their work to the given search terms, publication year, and citation count, among other factors. This expert score facilitates the discovery of leading researchers within a specific domain, providing valuable insight into their research contributions. As an open-source, scalable, and user-centric application, Doyen emerges as an invaluable tool in discovering domain experts, fostering collaboration within the research community, and empowering users to make informed decisions about research partners. The user interface provides seamless search and filtering capabilities, enabling users to discover experts aligned with their unique needs. The paper also explores the project's limitations, ethical concerns of ranking experts, and potential future enhancements.  \\
