\section{Team Strategy and Dynamics}

We organized to tackle the project by discussing team membersâ€™ backgrounds and surveying them to gauge the skill set of each team member. The plan is to get contributions from every team member and keep the balance between learning and utilizing the existing skill set. This balance will be maintained through feedback and discussion.

We largely followed an agile strategy for organizing our work and made decisions by a consensus process if disagreements came up. We set up a discord server to discuss project-related issues and get instant feedback from the team members. We have internal meetings twice a week and customer meetings once per week. We met each week on Monday evenings and:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Sprint Review
    \item Retrospective
    \item Review the Backlog
    \item Plan the next Sprint
\end{enumerate}
We also had a standing meeting with the customer once weekly on Fridays and met more or less as needed. In summary:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Sprints - Weekly
    \item Roles - Flat structure, with specialization into aspects of the project as needed.
    \item Ceremonies - Daily stand-up (on Discord)
    \item Backlog refinement - Part of our weekly meetings
    \item Sprint Planning - Part of our weekly meetings
    \item Daily Scrum - Daily stand-up (on Discord)
    \item Sprint Review - Part of our weekly meetings
    \item Retrospectives - Part of our weekly meetings
\end{itemize}
